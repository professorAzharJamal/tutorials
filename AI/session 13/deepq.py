# Define the state (replace with actual data representing the environment)
state = np.array([0.1, 0.5])  # Example state with two features

# Define possible actions (replace with actual actions)
actions = [0, 1]

# Simple neural network architecture (replace with more complex architecture for DQN)
weights = np.random.rand(len(state), len(actions))  # Random weights for state to action mapping

# Function to predict Q-values for all actions (replace with actual network forward pass)
def predict_q_values(state):
  q_values = np.dot(state, weights)  # Simple dot product for prediction
  return q_values

# Example usage
q_values = predict_q_values(state)
print(f"Predicted Q-values for actions: {q_values}")

# (Training would involve feeding experiences and updating weights based on errors)
